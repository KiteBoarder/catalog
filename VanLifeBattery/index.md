# Simple & Safe Power Setup for Van Life (No Big Battery System)

## The Problem
Many van-lifers do not want:
- A large house battery
- An inverter
- Permanent wiring or electrical mods

They only need:
- Phone and tablet power when the engine is OFF
- Zero risk of draining the vehicle’s starter battery

---

## The Solution
Use a **power bank that supports pass-through charging**.

👉 [Check the recommended power bank on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4jhyqLO)

This setup allows:
- The power bank to charge only when the engine is ON
- Your devices to draw power from the power bank when the engine is OFF
- The vehicle battery to stay protected at all times

---

## Why This Works (And Why It’s Safe)
Direct device charging from a car outlet is risky:
- Engine OFF + phone plugged in → starter battery drains ❌

With a pass-through power bank:
- Engine OFF → phone/tablet run from the power bank ✅
- Engine ON → power bank recharges automatically ✅

✅ The car battery is never used while parked.
