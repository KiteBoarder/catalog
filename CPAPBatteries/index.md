# Best Batteries That Work with CPAP

This post is for people who want to run a **CPAP machine on battery power**  
(van life, camping, power outages, travel).

## Batteries Compatible with CPAP Machines

### 🔋 INIU Power Bank
- Type: High-capacity power bank
- Output: USB-C PD (up to 65W on supported models)
- Works with CPAP when used with a **USB-C to DC converter**
- Compact and lightweight
- Best for: minimal setups, short overnight use

---

### 🔋 Baseus Power Bank
- Type: Power bank
- Output: USB-C PD (60W–100W depending on model)
- Works with CPAP using a **USB-C PD → DC adapter**
- Good balance between size and power
- Best for: single-night use with optimized settings

---

### 🔋 Anker Power Station
- Type: Portable power station
- Output: AC + DC + USB
- Can power CPAP directly via **AC outlet** or DC
- Much larger capacity than power banks
- Best for: multi-night use, reliability, off-grid setups

## Required Adapters for ResMed AirSense 10 & 11

### AirSense 10
- Needs a **12V or 24V DC converter** (official or third-party)
- Avoid AC inverter if possible (wastes power)
- DC cable is more efficient and extends runtime

### AirSense 11
- Requires **USB-C PD or 24V DC input**
- USB-C PD trigger cable (20V → 24V) is commonly used
- Works well with high-quality PD power banks

---

## Important Power-Saving Notes (Critical)

- **Turn OFF humidifier**
- **Turn OFF heated hose**
- These two features can **double or triple power consumption**
- With both OFF:
  - Power banks can last 1 night
  - Power stations can last multiple nights

---

## Summary
- Power banks (INIU / Baseus): portable, limited runtime
- Power stations (Anker): heavy, long runtime
- Always use DC or USB-C adapters
- Disable humidity and hose heating to maximize battery life
