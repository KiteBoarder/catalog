## Why Do You Need a Battery for a CPAP Machine?

CPAP machines are critical for people with sleep apnea, and power interruptions can seriously affect therapy. A reliable battery solution is essential for:

- Power outages
- Traveling
- Camping or off-grid use
- Vehicle or RV usage
- Areas with unstable electricity

This post lists **batteries and power stations that are commonly compatible with CPAP machines**.

## Things to Consider Before Buying a CPAP Battery

Before choosing a battery, make sure to check the following:

- 🔌 **Output voltage** (usually 12V or 24V)
- ⚡ **Power consumption of your CPAP**
- 🌬️ **Humidifier usage**  
  > Using a humidifier can increase power consumption by 2–3×
- 🔄 DC vs AC output (DC is more efficient)
- 🔋 Battery capacity (Wh or Ah)

## CPAP-Compatible Battery List

### 🔋 Dedicated CPAP Batteries

| Battery Name | Capacity | Output Voltage | Estimated Runtime* | Notes |
|-------------|----------|----------------|--------------------|------|
| Medistrom Pilot-24 Lite | 95Wh | 24V | 1–2 nights | Designed for ResMed devices |
| Medistrom Pilot-12 Lite | 95Wh | 12V | 1–2 nights | Designed for Philips devices |
| Freedom CPAP Battery | 160Wh | 12V / 24V | Up to 3 nights | Lightweight and FAA approved |
| Zopec Explore Mini | 297Wh | 12V / AC | 3–5 nights | High capacity, travel friendly |

\*Runtime estimates assume **no humidifier** and average pressure settings.

### 🔌 Portable Power Stations (Power Banks)

| Power Station | Capacity | Output | Estimated Runtime | Notes |
|--------------|----------|--------|-------------------|------|
| Jackery Explorer 240 | 240Wh | AC / DC | 2–3 nights | Reliable, compact |
| EcoFlow River 2 | 256Wh | AC / DC | 2–3 nights | Fast charging |
| Bluetti EB3A | 268Wh | AC / DC | 2–3 nights | Good value |
| Goal Zero Yeti 200X | 187Wh | AC / DC | 1–2 nights | Durable build |

> ⚠️ When using AC output, expect **10–20% efficiency loss** compared to DC.

---

## DC vs AC: Which Is Better?

- ✅ **DC output** → More efficient, longer runtime
- ❌ **AC output** → Easier setup but shorter battery life

If your CPAP supports DC input, always use a **DC cable**.
