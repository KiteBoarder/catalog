## Important Power-Saving Notes (Critical)

- **Turn OFF humidifier**
- **Turn OFF heated hose**
- These two features can **double or triple power consumption**

With both OFF:
- Power banks → usually **1 full night**
- Power stations → **multiple nights**

---

## Summary

- Power banks (INIU / Baseus): portable, limited runtime  
- Power stations (Anker): heavier, long runtime  
- Always use **DC or USB-C adapters**, not AC inverters  
- Disabling humidity and heated hose is essential for battery use
