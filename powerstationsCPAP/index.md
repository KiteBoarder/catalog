# 🔌 Best Bluetti Portable Power Stations for CPAP, Camping & Travel (2026 Guide)

Portable power stations have become essential gear for modern van life, camping trips, emergency backup, and off‑grid adventures — especially if you want to reliably power a CPAP machine overnight without mains access. Two standout Bluetti power stations worth considering in 2026 are the BLUETTI AC70 and the BLUETTI 288Wh Portable Power Station. Below you’ll find a practical comparison of both, helping you choose based on capacity, performance, and real‑world use.

## ⭐ 1. BLUETTI AC70 – Best Mid‑Size All‑Rounder  

### 🧠 Key Strengths
- Large Capacity (768 Wh): With a robust 768 Wh LiFePO₄ battery and pure sine wave inverter, it can power CPAP machines, laptops, phones, lights, and more for extended off‑grid use.  
- Fast Charging: AC70 can charge up to ~80 % in around 45 min and a full charge in under ~2 h from AC, which is fast for this battery class.  
- Strong Build & Safety: LiFePO₄ cells offer up to ~3,000 cycles before capacity drops to 80 %, meaning long life and excellent thermal stability for outdoor use.  
- Versatile Outputs: Two AC sockets, multiple USB‑C/A ports, and DC options let you run multiple devices at once.  
- Real‑World CPAP Runtime: Users report running a CPAP overnight (~8–9 h) on a single charge comfortably and even 2 nights with careful power management.  

### ⚠️ Cons & Limitations
- Heavier & Bulkier: At ~10 kg, it’s not breezily portable — better suited if you have space in a van or campsite setup.  
- Only 2 AC Outlets: Limited for powering many devices simultaneously without a power strip.  
- No Rugged IP Rating: While solidly built, it lacks formal weatherproofing for very wet conditions.  
- Occasional User Feedback on Sound: Some users note fan/relay noises during certain loads or conditions (not unusual in power stations but worth noting).  

✅ Best For: Weekend campers, van life, CPAP users needing ~1–2 nights of reliable power, and general outdoor adventurers.

## ⚡ 2. BLUETTI 288Wh Portable Power Station – Best Compact Choice  

### 🧠 Key Strengths
- Lightweight & Portable: With ~288 Wh capacity, it’s smaller, lighter, and easier to transport than larger units.  
- LiFePO₄ Battery Chemistry: Like its bigger sibling, it uses a long‑lasting LiFePO₄ cell that’s stable and safe with ~3,000+ charge cycles.  
- Fast Recharge: Most units around this size can recharge quickly (often <1.5 h to full from AC).  
- Portable Power Adequate for Short Trips: Based on typical performance estimates, it can run low‑draw devices — including smaller CPAP machines — for several hours, enough for many single‑night uses.  

### ⚠️ Cons & Limitations
- Lower Capacity: Only ~288 Wh means shorter run times — for many CPAP machines this might be ~6–8 h at best, depending on pressure settings and whether humidifier/heat are used.  
- Fewer Ports: You may be limited in how many devices you can power simultaneously.  
- Not Designed for Heavy Loads: High‑demand devices and appliances drain it quickly or may exceed its power rating.  

✅ Best For: Lightweight camping, day trips, digital nomads, or as an emergency backup for CPAP on single nights.
